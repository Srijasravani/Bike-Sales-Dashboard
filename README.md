First I looked at the data to understand its structure and contents.
I noticed that there were some duplicate entries, so I removed these to ensure that the data was clean and accurate.

Next, I created several pivot tables to summarize the data and make it easier to analyze. The first pivot table was for average income buyers, which allowed me to see which income brackets were most likely to buy bikes. The second pivot table was for customer age brackets, which showed me the distribution of customer ages and helped me identify any age-related trends. Finally, I created a pivot table for customer commute, which allowed me to see how far customers were traveling to purchase bikes.

Once the pivot tables were complete, I began building the dashboard. I wanted the dashboard to be easy to use and visually appealing, so I included a variety of charts and tables. The dashboard included filters for marital status, region, and education, which allowed me to explore the data in more detail and get a better understanding of customer behavior.

The final dashboard included several key features, such as a bar chart showing average income by buyer, a pie chart showing customer age brackets, and a table showing customer commute distances. I also added several interactive filters that allowed users to explore the data based on different criteria.

this project was successful in providing valuable insights into customer behavior for the bike sales company. By creating an interactive dashboard that was easy to use and visually appealing, I was able to present the data in a way that was both informative and engaging.
